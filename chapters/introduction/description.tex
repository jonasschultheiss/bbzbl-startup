\chapter{Company description} \label{description}

We are four young and motivated people who have founded a start-up called SkyPulse Technologies. SkyPulse Technologies is a public limited company. With this newly founded company, we have set ourselves the goal of speeding up and optimizing the transport of medicinal samples. This new time-optimized transport makes it possible to help patients better and improve collaboration between laboratories and hospitals. Transportation is achieved with our drones, which are controlled with \ac{ai}. These drones fly their routes between hospitals and laboratories and transport the respective samples.
\newline
The target market is therefore the pharmaceutical industry, and more specifically, hospitals and laboratories.
\newline
Our startup is divided into two different sectors. There is a technical division and a commercial division. The technical division is further divided into two different departments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \acl{rnd}
  \item \acl{pno}
\end{itemize}
The commercial department is also divided into three different departments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \acl{acc}
  \item \acl{adm}
  \item \acl{log}
\end{itemize}
We have divided up the various departments according to our interests. CÃ©line and Fabian are responsible for the \acl{rnd} department. Xenia is responsible for the \acl{pno} organization. Jonas is responsible for the \acl{acc} and all corresponding teams.
