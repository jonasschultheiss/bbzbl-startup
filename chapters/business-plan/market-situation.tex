\textbf{EU Drone Regulation (2019/947):} This overarching regulation sets the foundation for safe and secure drone operations across the EU. It categorizes drones based on weight and risk, with specific requirements for each category. \cite{a2022_drones}
\newline
\textbf{Open Category (C0):} Low-risk drones under 250 grams generally require minimal registration and pose minimal risk to healthcare deliveries. Medications typically wouldn't fall into this category.
\newline
\textbf{Specific Category (C1, C2, C3):} Drones exceeding 250 grams or posing a higher risk fall under this category. They require operator registration, authorization for specific operations, and adherence to safety measures like maintaining a visual line of sight (VLOS). This category would likely be most relevant for healthcare deliveries.
\newline
\textbf{Certified Category (C4):} High-risk operations beyond visual line of sight or involving transporting dangerous goods require extensive certification and authorization. Not applicable for most healthcare deliveries.
\newline
\textbf{EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) Guidelines:} EASA provides specific guidance for drone operations in the EU, including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) Systems:} These systems manage drone traffic in designated airspace, ensuring safe integration with manned aviation.

\newline
\textbf{Bazl (Federal Office for Civil Aviation):} Bazl provides information and resources for drone operators in Switzerland, including registration procedures and airspace restrictions.
\subsection{Additional Considerations}
\textbf{Data Protection:} Both the EU (GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation) and Switzerland have strict data protection regulations. Companies must ensure all medical information transported via drones is handled securely and compliantly.
\newline
\textbf{Privacy:} Public concerns regarding privacy intrusion from drone deliveries need to be addressed. Transparency regarding data collection and usage is essential.
\newline
\textbf{Insurance:} Liability insurance covering potential accidents or damage caused by drones during healthcare deliveries is crucial.
\subsection{Conclusion}
Regulations for drone operations are constantly evolving.  It's essential to stay informed about the latest updates from the EU and Swiss authorities to ensure your healthcare drone delivery service operates compliantly.
