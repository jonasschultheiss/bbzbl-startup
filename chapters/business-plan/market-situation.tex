\section{Competitor analysis}
Drone transportation is not yet very widespread, so there are not yet many competitors on the market. However, there are already one or two companies that offer drone transportation. One company called Zipline \cite{zipline_24} also offers drone transportation for medical samples, among other things. However, this is only a sub-category for them. They also transport food, for example. The same applies to another company called DroneUp \cite{droneup}, which offers almost the same services as Zipline \cite{zipline_24}. We at SkyPulse Technologies only offer transportation for medical samples and can therefore also transport very critical samples such as organs. By focusing only on the pharmaceutical industry, we are able to provide customized transport for samples and cater to the specific needs of our customers. With this service we distinguish ourselves from other companies that are already on the market. Our goal to help the patients, is achieved through Drone delivery with the highest quality, so that this transportation becomes an everyday business in the pharma industry.
