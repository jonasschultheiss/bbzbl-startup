\chapter*{Declaration of Authenticity}
\vspace*{-3.2cm}
I hereby declare that we:
\begin{itemize}
  \item have written this performance record independently and on our own;
  \item have correctly cited all text passages not originating from ourselves according to common scientific citation rules and that we have clearly mentioned the sources used \textbf{(Chapter \ref{label-sources})};
  \item have declared in an index all aids used (e.g. AI tools such as chatbots [e.g. ChatGPT], translation/paraphrasing tools) or programming applications [e.g. Github Copilot] and have indicated their use at the corresponding text passages \textbf{(Chapter \ref{label-aid-index})};
  \item have acquired all intangible rights to any materials we may have used, such as images or graphics, or that these materials were created by us;
  \item the topic, the paper or parts of it have not been used in a performance record of another module, unless this has been expressly agreed with the teacher in advance and is indicated in the paper;
  \item are aware that our work may be checked for plagiarism and for third-party authorship of human or technical origin (artificial intelligence);
  \item are aware that the teacher can set a grade of 1 in the event of unfair behavior.
\end{itemize}
